## Introduction
Tracking daily steps is an **important** aspect of maintaining an active lifestyle. This analysis examines the number of steps walked each day over a week and compares the results over time and with friends.
## Methodology
The data was collected using a fitness tracker and recorded daily. The following steps were taken:
`Steps`
1. Recorded step counts for a week.
2. Compared daily steps with previous weeks.
3. Compared steps with friends to analyze trends.

## Data Collection
- Steps were tracked using a fitness device.
- Data was logged into a spreadsheet.
- Weekly trends were calculated.
## Weekly Step Count
| Day       | Steps Walked |
|-----------|-------------|
| Monday    | 8,500       |
| Tuesday   | 9,200       |
| Wednesday | 7,800       |
| Thursday  | 10,000      |
| Friday    | 9,600       |
| Saturday  | 11,500      |
| Sunday    | 12,000      |
## Code for Step Analysis
To analyze the step data, we used Python:
```python
import pandas as pd
data = {'Day': ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'],
        'Steps': [8500, 9200, 7800, 10000, 9600, 11500, 12000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.describe())
```
## Observations
- *Tuesday* had a slightly higher step count than *Monday*.
- The highest step count was recorded on **Sunday**.
- There was a general increase in steps toward the weekend.
## Comparison with Friends
> "Walking together keeps us motivated!" – A friend from the study group
Here’s how my steps compared to my friends:
- Alice: **10,500** steps/day average
- Bob: **9,800** steps/day average
- Me: **9,800** steps/day average
## Further Improvements
Some ways to improve step count tracking:
- **Increase daily goals** to 12,000 steps.
- *Use a reminder app* to stay active throughout the day.
- Track steps using an advanced fitness tracker.
